# Slopflow

Turn AI slop into scoped, tested, reviewed, reversible changes.

Slopflow is a local CLI-runbook for controlled issue execution by AI coding agents.

The first vertical slice provides:

```bash
slopflow init
slopflow status
slopflow start <issue-id>
```

## Usage

Initialize Slopflow machine config in a Jujutsu-backed GitHub repo:

```bash
slopflow init
```

Inspect current Slopflow state:

```bash
slopflow status
```

Bootstrap controlled work for an existing issue:

```bash
slopflow start 2
```

`start` creates real bootstrap artifacts under `.slopflow/work/<issue-id>/`:

```text
issue.md
contract.md
status.json
goal-prompt.md
next-steps.md
```

It does not create placeholder evidence, review, or completion files.

## Development

Slopflow uses TypeScript and npm for the CLI implementation.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Build the CLI:

```bash
npm run build
```
